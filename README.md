# Factorization Project

This project includes C programs to factorize numbers. It consists of two tasks:
1. Factorize All the Things!
2. RSA Factoring Challenge

## Usage

### Factorize All the Things! (factors)

Compile the program:

Replace `<file>` with the path to the input file containing RSA numbers.

## File Descriptions

- `factors.c`: Main program for the "Factorize All the Things!" task.
- `factorize.h` and `factorize.c`: Header and implementation for factorization in the first task.
- `rsa.c`: Main program for the "RSA Factoring Challenge" task.
- `rsa_factorize.h` and `rsa_factorize.c`: Header and implementation for RSA factorization.
